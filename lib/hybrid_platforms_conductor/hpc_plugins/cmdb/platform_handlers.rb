      # CMDB getting metadata from the Platform Handlers directly
      class PlatformHandlers < HybridPlatformsConductor::Cmdb

        # get_* methods are automatically detected as possible metadata properties this plugin can fill.
        # The property name filled by such method is given by the method's name: get_my_property will fill the :my_property metadata.
        # The method get_others is used specifically to return properties whose name is unknown before fetching them.

        # Get a specific property for a given set of nodes.
        # [API] - @platforms_handler can be used.
        # [API] - @nodes_handler can be used.
        # [API] - @cmd_runner can be used.
        #
        # Parameters::
        # * *nodes* (Array<String>): The nodes to lookup the property for.
        # * *metadata* (Hash<String, Hash<Symbol,Object> >): Existing metadata for each node. Dependent properties should be present here.
        # Result::
        # * Hash<String, Object>: The corresponding property, per required node.
        #     Nodes for which the property can't be fetched can be ommitted.

        # Get other properties for a given set of nodes.
        # It's better to not use this method and prefer using methods naming the property being returned.
        # As the nodes_handler can't know in advance which properties will be returned, it will call it every time there is a missing property.
        # If this method always returns the same values, it would be clever to cache it here.
        # [API] - This method is optional.
        # [API] - @platforms_handler can be used.
        # [API] - @nodes_handler can be used.
        # [API] - @cmd_runner can be used.
        #
        # Parameters::
        # * *nodes* (Array<String>): The nodes to lookup the property for.
        # * *metadata* (Hash<String, Hash<Symbol,Object> >): Existing metadata for each node. Dependent properties should be present here.
        # Result::
        # * Hash<String, Hash<Symbol,Object> >: The corresponding properties, per required node.
