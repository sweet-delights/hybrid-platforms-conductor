  # It makes sure to remove passwords from memory for hardened security (this way if a vulnerability allows an attacker to dump the memory it won't get passwords).

  # * Configuration
  # * Environment variables
  # * Netrc file

      # * *credential_id* (Symbol): Credential ID this rule applies to

      #     * *resource* (String or nil): The resource for which we want credentials, or nil if none
